# mySMB Marketplace

**Curated agent plugins for SMB-focused business integrations.**

Accounting, CRM, HR, payroll, community, productivity — wrapped as Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and ready to install into [MyHub](https://github.com/mySMB-AI-Studio/myHubV2) tenants or directly into Claude Code.

## Quick start

Scaffold a new plugin project and start building widgets in your browser:

```
npx --package github:mySMB-AI-Studio/mysmb-marketplace -- create-mysmb-plugin my-plugin
cd my-plugin
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) — that's the **widget harness**. Edit a widget JSON and the preview updates live. The bottom panel lists every MCP server you've wired in `plugin/.mcp.json` and all the tools each one exposes.

In a second terminal, from the same folder:

```
claude
```

Claude Code reads the `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills/` we shipped in the scaffold and knows how to author plugins. Try:

> "Add a widget that shows my five most recent invoices."
>
> "Add a `$computed` helper that formats dates as `dd MMM`."
>
> "Add a slash command for creating a new contact."

Claude writes the file, you reload the harness, the change is live.

## What you can build

A plugin is a packaging unit. It can ship any combination of:

| Asset | What it is |
|---|---|
| **MCP server** | The tool API the LLM calls — `stdio`, `sse`, or `http`. Wire upstream npm packages or build your own. |
| **Skills** | Slash-command instructions for narrow tasks (`/<plugin>-<task>`). |
| **Agents** | A persona / sub-agent that owns a domain. |
| **Widgets** | Declarative JSON UI tiles for the MyHub dashboard. |
| **Widget elements** | JS helpers (`$computed` functions, composite components, actions) the widgets reference. |

You don't need all five. The minimum legal plugin is `plugin.json` + `.mcp.json` + `README.md`. Add the rest as your use case demands.

The same plugin installs in two places:

- **MyHub tenants** — auto-installed at provisioning time from the tenant's connector subscriptions.
- **Claude Code (CLI / Desktop / IDE)** — installed individually by any developer with one slash command.

---

## Prerequisites

Two things on your machine. Open your terminal and check whether each is already installed.

**Node.js 18 or newer.** Check with `node --version`. If you don't have it:

- **macOS** — [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh) once, then `brew install node`.
- **Windows** — `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` from PowerShell, or grab the installer at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
- **Linux** — use your distro's package manager, or [the official binaries](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

**Claude Code or Claude Desktop.**

- **Claude Code (CLI, recommended for plugin building)** — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`. Then run `claude` from any folder. Setup guide: [docs.claude.com/claude-code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).
- **Claude Desktop** — download from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download). The MCP servers your plugin defines can be wired into Claude Desktop too once you publish.

└── README.md                     ← per-project quickstart
```

The harness reads `plugin/widgets/*.json` for templates and `plugin/.mcp.json` for the live MCP client, so anything you (or Claude) write to `plugin/` shows up after a reload.

---

## Setting credentials

The harness reads `plugin/.mcp.json` and forwards `${VAR}` placeholders from your shell. Set them before `npm run dev`:

**macOS / Linux**
```
export MY_PLUGIN_API_TOKEN=xxx
npm run dev
```

**Windows PowerShell**
```
$env:MY_PLUGIN_API_TOKEN = "xxx"
npm run dev
```

Every `${VAR}` you reference in `.mcp.json` must also appear in `plugin/README.md` under a `## Configuration` heading — the marketplace validator enforces this.

---

## Publishing

When the plugin works the way you want:

1. Copy `plugin/` into the marketplace repo at `Plugins/plugins/<your-slug>/`.
2. Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
3. From the marketplace root: `npx tsx scripts/validate.ts` — it must report `validate: OK`.
4. Open a PR.

---

## Install an existing plugin

### In Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add mySMB-AI-Studio/mysmb-marketplace
/plugin install xero-accounting
```

Each plugin's README lists the env vars it needs under `## Configuration`.

### In a MyHub tenant

Tenants pick up new plugins automatically — MyHub clones this repo at provisioning time and installs every plugin a tenant has subscribed to. See the [MyHub repo](https://github.com/mySMB-AI-Studio/myHubV2) for the consumer-side wiring.

## Policy

Every plugin in this marketplace follows three rules:

1. **Any MCP transport is allowed.** `stdio`, `sse`, and streamable `http` are all supported. Pick whichever the upstream server ships with — stdio for local subprocesses, sse/http for remote services. The MyHub tenant runtime is a Linux container with outbound networking, so remote MCP servers work fine.
2. **All credentials via environment variables.** No hardcoded secrets, no interactive prompts at runtime, no OS keyring access. MyHub's connection UI collects credentials, stores them in Key Vault, and injects them into the MCP client at session start — `env` for stdio, `headers` for sse/http. Claude Code users set the same variables in their shell. Every `${VAR}` placeholder must be documented in the plugin's README under a `## Configuration` heading — the validator enforces this.
3. **Pure Node, no native binaries, no platform-specific code.** The same build artefact has to run on every tenant container and every developer machine.

### Server-distribution preference

When you have a choice, pick the highest option on this list:

1. **Official upstream MCP servers on npm** (e.g. `@xeroapi/xero-mcp-server`). Plugins launch them with `npx -y <pkg>@latest`. Upstream owns schema changes; first-run install cost is amortised by the tenant container image.
2. **Official upstream remote MCP servers** over `sse` or `http`. No install cost, no version drift. Trade-off: you depend on upstream availability and rate limits.
3. **Custom servers maintained in this repo**, with the compiled `dist/` output committed under `plugins/<name>/server/dist/`. Use only when no upstream exists or it's missing critical functionality.

```

1. MyHub clones this repo at provisioning time and reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
2. For each plugin a tenant has enabled, MyHub copies the plugin directory into the tenant's Claude Code config.
3. Reads `.mcp.json`, substitutes `${VAR}` placeholders with secrets from the tenant's Key Vault.
4. Starts the MCP server (subprocess for stdio, HTTP client for sse/http) when the tenant's Claude Code session begins.
